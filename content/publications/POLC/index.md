abstract: "It was shown in [[GIOZ19]](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/520) that enforcing sublinear communication complexity in secure multiparty computation drastically affects the feasibility bounds on the number of corrupted parties that can be tolerated in the setting of information-theoretic security.

We provide an investigation of security in the presence of semi-honest
mobile adversaries with erasures. We prove bounds on the corruptions that can be tolerated, which we also show to be essentially optimal."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "This paper is a **work in progress**. We provide an investigation of secure multiparty computation with information theoretic security and sublinear communication complexity in the presence of semi-honest mobile adversaries with erasures. We prove bounds on the corruptions that can be tolerated, which we also show to be essentially optimal."
