abstract: "We provide experimental evidence refuting assumptions made in [arXiv:2311.04378](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04378v2) [cs.LG]. We present queries and responses for which the specified perturbation attack fails and suggest an alternate attack with more realistic assumptions that succeeds in practice."
